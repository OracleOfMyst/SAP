# SAP
SomethingAboutPowershell is a tool designed to bypass Powershell ConstraintLangauge mode and gives you access to FullLanguage mode. This project came to mind after doing HTB CAPE modules. For you to be able to run this, you will need to follow the instructions below to build SAP.

# Setup
Make sure in your Visual Studio project you go to properties -> references and add the DLL `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System.Management.Automation\v4.0_3.0.0.0__31bf3856ad364e35\System.Management.Automation.dll` and change it from Debug to Release and build the program.
